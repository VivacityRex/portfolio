            Who is Vivacity?
          </h5>
          <p class="card-text">
            Well - I am Vivacity, an individual on the autism spectrum who has
            embarked on a remarkable journey of self-discovery and personal
            growth. My educational path took a different turn when I left public
            school in grade 9 due to being undiagnosed at the time. The
            traditional classroom environment posed significant challenges for
            me, and it became clear that I needed an alternative approach to
            learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an adult, I embarked on a quest to understand myself better and
            realized that my love for learning and education could be pursued
            outside the confines of a conventional classroom. I embraced online
            learning to complete my high school education, allowing me to
            navigate the academic landscape in a way that suited my unique needs
            and learning style.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eager to expand my knowledge and skills, I pursued upgrading classes
            from college, seeking to fill any gaps in my education. This
            dedication and commitment led me to achieve a diploma in Accounting,
            a testament to my perseverance and determination.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, my thirst for knowledge and curiosity knew no bounds. It
            was during this time that I discovered my true passion – coding. I
            found solace and excitement in the world of programming, where
            creativity and problem-solving converge. I became enamored with the
            endless possibilities and the opportunity to continuously learn and
            grow in this field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Driven by my love for learning and the desire to make up for lost
            time, I fully immersed myself in the world of coding. I eagerly
            absorbed as much knowledge as possible, honing my skills and
            expanding my expertise. Each new concept and programming language
            became a stepping stone on my path to mastery.
          </p>
          <p>
            My story is one of resilience, determination, and an unwavering
            dedication to personal and professional development. By embracing a
            non-traditional educational path, I have discovered the power of
            self-directed learning and the transformative impact it can have on
            one's life. My journey serves as a testament to the importance of
            adaptability, a growth mindset, and the pursuit of one's passions.

            Iran), they were favored by nobility and royalty centuries ago.

            continue to captivate the hearts of cat lovers around the world.

            Vivacity finds solace in nature, particularly during walks where
            human interference is minimal. Exploring serene environments and
            immersing themselves in untouched landscapes offer moments of
            tranquility and a chance to connect with the natural world.

            life with their unique personalities and unconditional love.
          </p>
          <p class="vivacity fs-3 pt-4">Fascination with History</p>
          <p>
            History has always captivated Vivacity's imagination, with a
            particular interest in the War of the Roses. This tumultuous period
            in English history marked a power struggle between the Houses of
            York and Lancaster for the throne of England. Exploring the
            political intrigues and battles of this era offers insights into the
            dynamics of power and the resilience of individuals caught in the

            seeks out opportunities to learn and expand their coding skills.
            Through various online platforms, Vivacity has explored different
            websites and found SheCodes to be an easily understandable and
            immersive learning experience. However, their quest for knowledge
            doesn't end there, as they continue to search for similar courses to
            further enhance their coding expertise.
          </p>

            In the gaming world, Vivacity finds an exciting realm of exploration
            and entertainment. While predominantly immersed in the World of
            Warcraft (WoW) as part of the Alliance, they occasionally venture
            into other games such as GTA 5, Skyrim, and Neverwinter.
          </p>
          <p class="vivacity fs-3 pt-4">Love for Books</p>
          <p>
            Vivacity finds literary solace in the enchanting works of Jane
            Austen, with the new film adaptation of "Emma" being a favorite at
            the moment. Delving into the world of Austen's timeless romances
